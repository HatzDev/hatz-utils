# Hatz Utils


## What is this ?

This is a simple API that I developed to help me with my mods, and also help other people who want to use it.

## How to use ? (For Devs)

I will still create the Wiki explaining exactly how to use it, stay tuned! But if you want, feel free to look at the source code.
